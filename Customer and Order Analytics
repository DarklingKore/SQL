#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--Question #1
--How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID'
;

--Question #2
--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID'
;

--Question #3
--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'ORDER ID'
;

--Question #4
--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
; 

--Question #5
--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
;

--Question #6
--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT
SUM(Quantity),
product,
SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
Where location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product
;

--Question #7
--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
Left JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE FEB.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP By cust.acctnum
;

--Question #8
--List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT distinct Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product
;

--Question #9 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).

SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
Where location like '%NY%'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID)>2
;

--Question #10 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT product, sum(Quantity) as headphones_sold
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%headphone%'
GROUP BY Product
;

--Question #11 What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)

SELECT avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id

WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID'
;

--Question #12 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
on Feb.orderID=cust.order_id

WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID'
;

--Question #13 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT Product, 
sum(quantity*price) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc
LIMIT 1
;
